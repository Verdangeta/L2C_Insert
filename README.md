This repository contains the code implementation of paper [Learning to Insert for Constructive Neural Vehicle Routing Solver](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SXr3Dynctm). 
In this paper, we propose Learning to Construct with Insertion-based Paradigm (L2C-Insert), a novel insertion-based learning framework for constructive NCO.
### Dependencies
```bash
Python=3.8.6
matplotlib==3.5.2
numpy==1.23.3
pandas==1.5.1
pytz==2022.1
torch==1.12.1
torchaudio==0.12.1
torchvision==0.13.1
tqdm==4.64.1
```
Also see `environment.yml`.

### Datasets and pre-trained models
The training and test datasets can be downloaded from Google Drive:
```bash
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pJr3W8lbtAcbP9qfs82VJCjXbqOGQW02?usp=sharing
```
or  Baidu Cloud:

```

### Implementation

#### Testing
```bash
TSP:
    cd L2C_Insert/TSP/Test
    python test_synthetic.py (on the synthetic dataset)
    python test_lib.py (on the tsplib dataset)
CVRP:
    cd L2C_Insert/CVRP/Test
    python test_synthetic.py (on the synthetic dataset)
    python test_lib.py (on the cvrplib dataset)
```

#### Training
```bash
TSP:
    cd /L2C_Insert/TSP/Train
    python train.py
CVRP:
    cd /L2C_Insert/CVRP/Train
    python train.py
```
